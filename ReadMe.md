## SUBMIT A GUESS

Right next to "I see...", an area is given for the number submission.
The player may input a number between 0 and the maximum value corresponding to the level chosen.
Should the number input not follow the game's rules, it will be fixed as follows :

    - The number given is lower than 0 ⮕ The number is fixed to 0.
    - The number given is higher than the maximum value ⮕ The Number is fixed to the maximum value.
    - The number given is not a whole number ⮕ The number is fixed to the nearest rounded number.

Right next to (or under, depending on the device used) the player can click on "Am I right?" to submit their choice.

## CHANCES

As long as the player does not find the secret number, they are given another chance and a tip until they reach their last chance.

If the secret number has still not been found, the player loses the round.

If the secret number has been found (no matter what chance), the player wins the round.

## NEW ROUND

After the player either wins or loses a round, they are given an opportunity to play another round.

If the player clicks on "Yes!", a new round is launched similarly to the first one.

If the player clicks on "No.", the game is over and the scores are shown.
